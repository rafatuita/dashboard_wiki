we are doing.

## Frontend

We are following conventions described in [Angular 1 Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md) and [Material Design Guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/).

Additionally, check list of rules and tips, that we are using:

- Private method and variable names should end with a `_`.
- In order to keep all tooltips consistent across whole application, we have decided to use 500 ms delay and auto-hide option. It allows us to avoid flickering when moving mouse over the pages and to hide tooltips after mouse is elsewhere but focus is still on the element with tooltip.
